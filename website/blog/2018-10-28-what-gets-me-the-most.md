Another sleepless night, this time have to blame myself for sleeping in the afternoon. Viewer discretion is advised.

Who is a "friend", and what is "friendship"? The more I think I know, the less I truly know.

A DuckDuckGo search on _quotes on friendship_ and I find this.
> * “Friendship is the hardest thing in the world to explain. It's not something you learn in school. But if you haven't learned the meaning of friendship, you really haven't learned anything.”
― Muhammad Ali
* “What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.”
― Aristotle
* “A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you.”
― Elbert Hubbard

What the hell is all of this, is this how humans work? And especially the last one, lol read this blog for a piece of my real mind, I'm pretty sure most people will think I'm crazy, the rest will ask me to be positive and say that will keep more people around me.  

  I'm quoting the [Owl of Bird Wisdom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozmu-1Rv7g) again
> __The Owl of Bird Wisdom :__  Maybe if you were positive to people you encounter, you wouldn't be so lonely  
__Annabelle :__ If I told people things that I didn't believe to make them feel better about themselves, I would probably have a lot more friends, but none of them will really know me so I would still feel alone. I just don't fit in this world I think....

At this point anyone will be _Dude what's your problem?_, so what is my problem?

So what is being close to a person, a close friend as they call it. Well as far as I understand you and the person share things in common, they understand your problems, they share their problems, they try to help with your problems, you try to help with theirs, __they invite you to events__. Am I right?

__What gets me the most__ (Roll credits) is losing touch with a friend. What in the hell does that even mean? Logically this confuses me the most, if you are close to a person then how do you lose touch with them? You don't see them often? They move to a different place? You don't talk to them?

I don't blame any of the above questions except the last one _You don't talk to them?_, guess this is the peck of my frustration, I am an introvert, I have trouble socialising, when I do get acquainted I do everything I can in my power to help them, understand them, defend them, and tolerate the things I don't like in them.

So when weeks pass without seeing an acquaintance, my anxiety makes me think that they have lost touch with me. So after repeated struggles I make up my mind to send a message to them. It goes as follows.  

Example happy conversation
> __Me:__ Hey  
__X:__  Hey  
__Me:__ Long time no see, how are you?  
__X:__ Yeah fine, what about you?  
__Me:__ Fine, anything new?  
__X:__ No, what about you?  
__Me:__ _Tell about new thing Y that happened_  
__X:__ Oh great

End of conversation, at this point my mind is saying to me that I'm losing X. __Hey X is your friend, if something is bothering you say it to X__.

Example of a conversation for help
> __Me:__ Hey, why is it scenario S happens anyway, why can't people be more considerate  
__X:__ _Says something to make me feel better_

I feel better, so I feel that I'm grateful to have X as a friend. This type of conversation happens a couple of times. Wait I'm just complaining to X, I literally know nothing about them. I don't know how to learn more about them, they don't see me as worthy to share their problems. I make up my mind to stop complaining, boom the first type of conversation happens, and after a couple of months they are gone from my life, all because I didn't talk to them. I didn't know what to talk to them. It's all my fault.

_Wow buddy it's ok to just share your problem:_ Really having a person in your life who does only one thing COMPLAIN, after a point I'm sure any human will be pissed off.

_Just ask something about them, is it so hard?_ Yes it is, I have had __several__ incidents in the past were people have refused, asked me to mind my own business. _Well you weren't exactly **close** to them, so when you asked about X they didn't reply_. This is exactly it, I'm not close enough.

_Don't be pessimistic, I'm sure you'll find a friend_  
Make a friend -> They move away -> Try to stay in touch -> Conversation starts to loop over what I've specified -> Seen Zoned

_I give up, your hopeless:_ This is who I am, a troubled and unsettling mind (Roll Credits). Making a friend who understand my mental issues, let me just hope for the best. And even when I do make a friend, expecting that they will feel close to me the same way I do about them, I'll just hope for the best. And making the friendship last over time, human's change so let me hope for the best. I'm one gullible idiot.
