### Design Guideline 1 - Law of Demeter

Stumpled across this from PMD at 2AM at office ðŸ˜“, and what did I do?? Ping chat
about the topic, fix my code and sleep

<!-- truncate -->

#### What is the Law of Demeter?
- Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units "closely" related to the current unit.
- Each unit should only talk to its friends; don't talk to strangers.
- Only talk to your immediate friend

In simple terms
> LoD tells us that it is a bad idea for single functions to know the entire navigation structure of the system.

``` java
class A {

  public void method1(O obj) {
    // Class A has unnecessary access to objects X, Y, Z
    // Don't talk to strangers.
    obj.getX()
          .getY()
            .getZ()
              .doSomething();
  }

  public void method2(O obj) {
    // Have maybe a utility method which does this
    obj.doSomething();
  }

}
```

#### Why use the Law of Demeter?
Law of Demeter stems from Seperation of Concerns. Following it reduces the
coupling between modules and it increases maintainability.

#### An example of why coupling will become a problem?

Currently Class A **directly** depends on Class O.

After a few months the code might become something like this.

```java
class A {

  public void method1(O obj) {
    X = obj.getX();

    X.doSomethingElse();

    X.getY()
      .getZ()
      .doSomething();
  }

}
```

Now Class A is **directly** depends on both Class O and Class X. Let's say owner of Class O want to deprecate the use of Class X as he is moving to a new model.

He will not be able to as he needs to deal with the dependency in Class A.

This also affects the testability of Class A.
