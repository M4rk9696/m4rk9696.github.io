I started open-source first with [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). It's been two months learning 
from the open-source projects and I see this.  

[I don't know what to say.](https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream/issues/116)  

What worries me is toxic the GitHub thread suddenly became. 
Did a [small post](https://dev.to/m4rk9696/npm-we-all-knew-this-would-happen-eventually-16fl) in Dev.to about this.  

I'm putting an extended analysis which would be probably boring here

The most decent toxic comment I found while the thread was extremely hot
was *You should be in jail*.

Is there something fundamentally wrong our idea about OpenSourceSoftware.  

From my point of view there are three groups  

Group A
- I can afford the professional/enterprise solution, I'll audit this OSS solution if it can really suit my need
- I can't add this as a dependency, without a security audit and a legal audit
- There's a security vulnerability, I guess I should migrate/help fix it

Group B
- I can't afford the professional/enterprise solution, my company/project is small, I'll use this OSS solution
- This license is ok for me
- There's a security vulnerability, I guess I should migrate/help fix it

Group C
- I don't want to pay for it, has to be free
- License what? I thought it was free
- There's a security vulnerability, the maintainer should be sued.

In my perspective Group C are just abusing OSS as a cash free solution.  

Open Source is about community, it's about learning, it's about being able
to be anything outside your job. Hate speech against a person doing community work is not right.  

**Satire is ok, hate speech is not. Let's stand up against hate speech**
